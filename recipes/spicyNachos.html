        <li>Â¾ cup water </li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) package restaurant-style tortilla chips </li>
        <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste </li>
        <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can refried beans </li>
        <li>1 cup salsa </li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream, or more to taste </li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can pitted black olives, drained and chopped </li>
        <li>4 green onions, diced </li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced jalapeno peppers, drained </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning mix and water and simmer until beef mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet; top with Cheddar cheese and dot with refried beans and ground beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, watching carefully to prevent burning, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top nachos with salsa, sour cream, black olives, green onions, and jalapeno peppers.</li>
    </ol>
